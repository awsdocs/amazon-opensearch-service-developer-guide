# Cross\-cluster replication for Amazon OpenSearch Service<a name="replication"></a>

With cross\-cluster replication in Amazon OpenSearch Service, you can replicate indexes, mappings, and metadata from one OpenSearch Service domain to another\. It follows an active\-passive replication model where the follower index \(where the data is replicated\) pulls data from the leader index\. Using cross\-cluster replication helps to ensure disaster recovery if there is an outage, and allows you to replicate data across geographically distant data centers to reduce latency\.

Cross\-cluster replication is available on domains running Elasticsearch 7\.10 or OpenSearch 1\.1 or later\. Full documentation for cross\-cluster replication is available in the [OpenSearch documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/replication-plugin/index/)\.

## Limitations<a name="replication-limitations"></a>

Cross\-cluster replication has the following limitations:
+ You can't replicate data between Amazon OpenSearch Service domains and self\-managed OpenSearch or Elasticsearch clusters\.
+ A domain can be connected, through a combination of inbound and outbound connections, to a maximum of 20 other domains\.
+ Domains must either share the same major version, or be on the final minor version and the next major version\.
+ You can't use AWS CloudFormation to connect domains\.
+ You can't use cross\-cluster replication on M3 or burstable \(T2 and T3\) instances\.

## Prerequisites<a name="replication-prereqs"></a>

Before you set up cross\-cluster replication, make sure that your domains meet the following requirements:
+ Elasticsearch 7\.10 or OpenSearch 1\.1 or later
+ [Fine\-grained access control](fgac.md) enabled
+ [Node\-to\-node encryption](ntn.md) enabled

## Permissions requirements<a name="replication-permissions"></a>

In order to start replication, you must include the `es:ESCrossClusterGet` permission on the remote \(leader\) domain\. We recommend the following IAM policy on the remote domain \(which also lets you perform other operations, such as indexing documents and performing standard searches\):

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": [
          "*"
        ]
      },
      "Action": [
        "es:ESHttp*"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:es:region:account:domain/leader-domain/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "*"
      },
      "Action": "es:ESCrossClusterGet",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:es:region:account:domain/leader-domain"
    }
  ]
}
```

Make sure that the `es:ESCrossClusterGet` permission is applied for `/leader-domain` and not `/leader-domain/*`\.

In order for non\-admin users to perform replication activities, they also need to be mapped to the appropriate permissions\. Most permissions correspond to specific [REST API operations](https://opensearch.org/docs/replication-plugin/api/)\. For example, the `indices:admin/plugins/replication/index/_resume` permission lets you resume replication of an index\. For a full list of permissions, see [Replication permissions](https://opensearch.org/docs/replication-plugin/permissions/#replication-permissions) in the OpenSearch documentation\.

**Note**  
The commands to start replication and create a replication rule are special cases\. Because they invoke background processes on the leader and follower domains, you must pass a `leader_cluster_role` and `follower_cluster_role` in the request\. OpenSearch Service uses these roles in all backend replication tasks\. For information about mapping and using these roles, see [Map the leader and follower cluster roles](https://opensearch.org/docs/replication-plugin/permissions/#map-the-leader-and-follower-cluster-roles) in the OpenSearch documentation\.

## Set up a cross\-cluster connection<a name="replication-connect"></a>

To replicate indexes from one domain to another, you need to set up a cross\-cluster connection between the domains\. The easiest way to connect domains is through the **Connections** tab of the domain dashboard\. You can also use the [configuration API](configuration-api.md) or the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/opensearch/create-outbound-connection.html)\. Because cross\-cluster replication follows a "pull" model, you initate connections from the follower domain\.

**Note**  
If you previously connected two domains to perform [cross\-cluster searches](cross-cluster-search.md), you can't use that same connection for replication\. The connection is marked as `SEARCH_ONLY` in the console\. In order to perform replication between two previously connected domains, you must delete the connection and recreate it\. When you've done this, the connection is available for both cross\-cluster search and cross\-cluster replication\.

**To set up a connection**

1. In the Amazon OpenSearch Service console, select the follower domain, go to the **Connections** tab, and choose **Request**\.

1. For **Connection alias**, enter a name for your connection\.

1. Choose between connecting to a domain in your AWS account and Region or in another account or Region\.
   + To connect to a domain in your AWS account and Region, select the domain and choose **Request**\.
   + To connect to a domain in another AWS account or Region, specify the ARN of the remote domain and choose **Request**\.

OpenSearch Service validates the connection request\. If the domains are incompatible, the connection fails\. If validation succeeds, it's sent to the destination domain for approval\. When the destination domain approves the request, you can begin replication\. 

## Start replication<a name="replication-start"></a>

After you establish a cross\-cluster connection, you can begin to replicate data\. First, create an index on the leader domain to replicate: 

```
PUT leader-01
```

To replicate that index, send this command to the follower domain:

```
PUT _plugins/_replication/follower-01/_start
{
   "leader_alias": "connection-alias",
   "leader_index": "leader-01",
   "use_roles":{
      "leader_cluster_role": "all_access",
      "follower_cluster_role": "all_access"
   }
}
```

You can find the connection alias on the **Connections** tab on your domain dashboard\.

This example assumes that an admin is issuing the request and uses `all_access` for the `leader_cluster_role` and `follower_cluster_role` for simplicity\. In production environments, however, we recommend that you create replication users on both the leader and follower indexes, and map them accordingly\. The user names must be identical\. For information about these roles and how to map them, see [Map the leader and follower cluster roles](https://opensearch.org/docs/replication-plugin/permissions/#map-the-leader-and-follower-cluster-roles) in the OpenSearch documentation\.

## Confirm replication<a name="replication-confirm"></a>

To confirm that replication is happening, get the replication status:

```
GET _plugins/_replication/follower-01/_status

{
  "status" : "SYNCING",
  "reason" : "User initiated",
  "leader_alias" : "connection-alias",
  "leader_index" : "leader-01",
  "follower_index" : "follower-01",
  "syncing_details" : {
    "leader_checkpoint" : -5,
    "follower_checkpoint" : -5,
    "seq_no" : 0
  }
}
```

The leader and follower checkpoint values begin as negative integers and reflect the number of shards you have \(\-1 for one shard, \-5 for five shards, and so on\)\. The values increment to positive integers with each change that you make\. If the values are the same, it means that the indexes are fully synced\. You can use these checkpoint values to measure replication latency across your domains\.

To further validate replication, add a document to the leader index:

```
PUT leader-01/_doc/1
{
   "Doctor Sleep":"Stephen King"
}
```

And confirm that it shows up on the follower index:

```
GET follower-01/_search

{
    ...
    "max_score" : 1.0,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "follower-01",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "Doctor Sleep" : "Stephen King"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Pause and resume replication<a name="replication-pause-resume"></a>

You can temporarily pause replication if you need to remediate issues or reduce load on the leader domain\. Send this request to the follower domain\. Make sure to include an empty request body:

```
POST _plugins/_replication/follower-01/_pause
{}
```

Then get the status to ensure that replication is paused:

```
GET _plugins/_replication/follower-01/_status

{
  "status" : "PAUSED",
  "reason" : "User initiated",
  "leader_alias" : "connection-alias",
  "leader_index" : "leader-01",
  "follower_index" : "follower-01"
}
```

When you're done making changes, resume replication\. Send this request to the follower domain\. Make sure to include an empty request body:

```
POST _plugins/_replication/follower-01/_resume
{}
```

You can't resume replication after it's been paused for more than 12 hours\. You must stop replication, delete the follower index, and restart replication of the leader\.

## Stop replication<a name="replication-stop"></a>

When you stop replication completely, the follower index unfollows the leader and becomes a standard index\. You can't restart replication after you stop it\.

Stop replication from the follower domain\. Make sure to include an empty request body:

```
POST _plugins/_replication/follower-01/_stop
{}
```

## Auto\-follow<a name="replication-autofollow"></a>

You can define a set of replication rules against a single leader domain that automatically replicate indexes that match a specified pattern\. When an index on the leader domain matches one of the patterns \(for example, `books*`\), a matching follower index is created on the follower domain\. OpenSearch Service replicates any existing indexes that match the pattern, as well as new indexes that you create\. It does not replicate indexes that already exist on the follower domain\.

To replicate all indexes \(with the exception of system\-created indexes, and those that already exist on the follower domain\), use a wildcard \(`*`\) pattern\. 

### Create a replication rule<a name="replication-rule-create"></a>

Create a replication rule on the follower domain, and specify the name of the cross\-cluster connection:

```
POST _plugins/_replication/_autofollow
{
   "leader_alias" : "connection-alias",
   "name": "rule-name",
   "pattern": "books*",
   "use_roles":{
      "leader_cluster_role": "all_access",
      "follower_cluster_role": "all_access"
   }
}
```

You can find the connection alias on the **Connections** tab on your domain dashboard\.

This example assumes that an admin is issuing the request, and it uses `all_access` as the leader and follower domain roles for simplicity\. In production environments, however, we recommend that you create replication users on both the leader and follower indexes and map them accordingly\. The user names must be identical\. For information about these roles and how to map them, see [Map the leader and follower cluster roles](https://opensearch.org/docs/replication-plugin/permissions/#map-the-leader-and-follower-cluster-roles) in the OpenSearch documentation\.

To retrieve a list of existing replication rules on a domain, use the [auto\-follow stats API operation](https://opensearch.org/docs/replication-plugin/api/#get-auto-follow-stats)\.

To test the rule, create an index that matches the pattern on the leader domain:

```
PUT books-are-fun
```

And check that its replica appears on the follower domain:

```
GET _cat/indices

health status index          uuid                     pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
green  open   books-are-fun  ldfHO78xYYdxRMULuiTvSQ     1   1          0            0       208b           208b
```

### Delete a replication rule<a name="replication-rule-delete"></a>

When you delete a replication rule, OpenSearch Service stops replicating *new* indices that match the pattern, but continues existing replication activity until you [stop replication](#replication-stop) of those indexes\.

Delete replication rules from the follower domain:

```
DELETE _plugins/_replication/_autofollow
{
   "leader_alias" : "connection-alias",
   "name": "rule-name"
}
```
