# Monitoring OpenSearch cluster metrics with Amazon CloudWatch<a name="managedomains-cloudwatchmetrics"></a>

Amazon OpenSearch Service publishes data from your domains to Amazon CloudWatch\. CloudWatch lets you retrieve statistics about those data points as an ordered set of time\-series data, known as *metrics*\. OpenSearch Service sends metrics to CloudWatch in 60\-second intervals\. If you use General Purpose or Magnetic EBS volumes, the EBS volume metrics update only every five minutes\. For more information about Amazon CloudWatch, see the [Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/)\.

The OpenSearch Service console displays a series of charts based on the raw data from CloudWatch\. Depending on your needs, you might prefer to view cluster data in CloudWatch instead of the graphs in the console\. The service archives metrics for two weeks before discarding them\. The metrics are provided at no extra charge, but CloudWatch still charges for creating dashboards and alarms\. For more information, see [Amazon CloudWatch pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/)\.

## Viewing metrics in CloudWatch<a name="managedomains-viewmetrics"></a>

CloudWatch metrics are grouped first by the service namespace, and then by the various dimension combinations within each namespace\. 

**To view metrics using the CloudWatch console**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **All metrics** and select the **AWS/ES** namespace\.

1. Choose a dimension to view the corresponding metrics\. Metrics for individual nodes are in the `ClientId, DomainName, NodeId` dimension\. Cluster metrics are in the `Per-Domain, Per-Client Metrics` dimension\. Some node metrics are aggregated at the cluster level and thus included in both dimensions\. Shard metrics are in the `ClientId, DomainName, NodeId, ShardRole` dimension\.

**To view a list of metrics using the AWS CLI**

Run the following command:

```
aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace "AWS/ES"
```

## Interpreting health charts in OpenSearch Service<a name="managedomains-cloudwatchmetrics-box-charts"></a>

To view metrics in OpenSearch Service, use the **Cluster health** and **Instance health** tabs\. The **Instance health** tab uses box charts to provide at\-a\-glance visibility into the health of each OpenSearch node:

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/images/box-charts.png)
+ Each colored box shows the range of values for the node over the specified time period\.
+ Blue boxes represent values that are consistent with other nodes\. Red boxes represent outliers\.
+ The white line within each box shows the node's current value\.
+ The “whiskers” on either side of each box show the minimum and maximum values for all nodes over the time period\.

If you make configuration changes to your domain, the list of individual instances in the **Cluster health** and **Instance health** tabs often double in size for a brief period before returning to the correct number\. For an explanation of this behavior, see [Making configuration changes in Amazon OpenSearch Service](managedomains-configuration-changes.md)\.

## Cluster metrics<a name="managedomains-cloudwatchmetrics-cluster-metrics"></a>

Amazon OpenSearch Service provides the following metrics for clusters\.


| Metric | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| ClusterStatus\.green |  A value of 1 indicates that all index shards are allocated to nodes in the cluster\. Relevant statistics: Maximum  | 
| ClusterStatus\.yellow | A value of 1 indicates that the primary shards for all indexes are allocated to nodes in the cluster, but replica shards for at least one index are not\. For more information, see [Yellow cluster status](handling-errors.md#handling-errors-yellow-cluster-status)\.Relevant statistics: Maximum | 
| ClusterStatus\.red |  A value of 1 indicates that the primary and replica shards for at least one index are not allocated to nodes in the cluster\. For more information, see [Red cluster status](handling-errors.md#handling-errors-red-cluster-status)\. Relevant statistics: Maximum  |

| Shards\.unassigned |  The number of shards that are not allocated to nodes in the cluster\. Relevant statistics: Maximum, Sum  | 
| Shards\.delayedUnassigned |  The number of shards whose node allocation has been delayed by the timeout settings\. Relevant statistics: Maximum, Sum  | 
| Shards\.activePrimary |  The number of active primary shards\. Relevant statistics: Maximum, Sum  | 
| Shards\.initializing |  The number of shards that are under initialization\. Relevant statistics: Sum  | 
| Shards\.relocating |  The number of shards that are under relocation\. Relevant statistics: Sum  | 
| Nodes |  The number of nodes in the OpenSearch Service cluster, including dedicated master nodes and UltraWarm nodes\. For more information, see [Making configuration changes in Amazon OpenSearch Service](managedomains-configuration-changes.md)\. Relevant statistics: Maximum  | 
| SearchableDocuments |  The total number of searchable documents across all data nodes in the cluster\. Relevant statistics: Minimum, Maximum, Average  | 
| DeletedDocuments |  The total number of documents marked for deletion across all data nodes in the cluster\. These documents no longer appear in search results, but OpenSearch only removes deleted documents from disk during segment merges\. This metric increases after delete requests and decreases after segment merges\. Relevant statistics: Minimum, Maximum, Average  | 
| CPUUtilization |  The percentage of CPU usage for data nodes in the cluster\. Maximum shows the node with the highest CPU usage\. Average represents all nodes in the cluster\. This metric is also available for individual nodes\. Relevant statistics: Maximum, Average  | 
| FreeStorageSpace |  The free space for data nodes in the cluster\. `Sum` shows total free space for the cluster, but you must leave the period at one minute to get an accurate value\. `Minimum` and `Maximum` show the nodes with the least and most free space, respectively\. This metric is also available for individual nodes\. OpenSearch Service throws a `ClusterBlockException` when this metric reaches `0`\. To recover, you must either delete indexes, add larger instances, or add EBS\-based storage to existing instances\. To learn more, see [Lack of available storage space](handling-errors.md#handling-errors-watermark)\. The OpenSearch Service console displays this value in GiB\. The Amazon CloudWatch console displays it in MiB\.  `FreeStorageSpace` will always be lower than the values that the OpenSearch `_cluster/stats` and `_cat/allocation` APIs provide\. OpenSearch Service reserves a percentage of the storage space on each instance for internal operations\. For more information, see [Calculating storage requirements](sizing-domains.md#bp-storage)\.  Relevant statistics: Minimum, Maximum, Average, Sum  | 
| ClusterUsedSpace |  The total used space for the cluster\. You must leave the period at one minute to get an accurate value\. The OpenSearch Service console displays this value in GiB\. The Amazon CloudWatch console displays it in MiB\. Relevant statistics: Minimum, Maximum  | 
| ClusterIndexWritesBlocked |  Indicates whether your cluster is accepting or blocking incoming write requests\. A value of 0 means that the cluster is accepting requests\. A value of 1 means that it is blocking requests\. Some common factors include the following: `FreeStorageSpace` is too low or `JVMMemoryPressure` is too high\. To alleviate this issue, consider adding more disk space or scaling your cluster\. Relevant statistics: Maximum  | 
| JVMMemoryPressure |  The maximum percentage of the Java heap used for all data nodes in the cluster\. OpenSearch Service uses half of an instance's RAM for the Java heap, up to a heap size of 32 GiB\. You can scale instances vertically up to 64 GiB of RAM, at which point you can scale horizontally by adding instances\. See [Recommended CloudWatch alarms for Amazon OpenSearch Service](cloudwatch-alarms.md)\. Relevant statistics: Maximum  The logic for this metric changed in a recent service software update\. For more information, see the [release notes](release-notes.md)\.   |

For more information, see [CPU credits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-credits-baseline-concepts.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Developer Guide*\. This metric is available only for the T2 instance types\. Relevant statistics: Minimum  | 
| OpenSearchDashboardsHealthyNodes \(previously KibanaHealthyNodes\) |  A health check for OpenSearch Dashboards\. If the minimum, maximum, and average are all equal to 1, Dashboards is behaving normally\. If you have 10 nodes with a maximum of 1, minimum of 0, and average of 0\.7, this means 7 nodes \(70%\) are healthy and 3 nodes \(30%\) are unhealthy\. Relevant statistics: Minimum, Maximum, Average  | 
| KibanaReportingFailedRequestSysErrCount |  The number of requests to generate OpenSearch Dashboards reports that failed due to server problems or feature limitations\. Relevant statistics: Sum  |

| KibanaReportingRequestCount |  The total number of requests to generate OpenSearch Dashboards reports\. Relevant statistics: Sum  | 
| KibanaReportingSuccessCount |  The number of successful requests to generate OpenSearch Dashboards reports\. Relevant statistics: Sum  | 
| KMSKeyError |  A value of 1 indicates that the AWS KMS key used to encrypt data at rest has been disabled\. To restore the domain to normal operations, re\-enable the key\. The console displays this metric only for domains that encrypt data at rest\. Relevant statistics: Minimum, Maximum  | 
| KMSKeyInaccessible |  A value of 1 indicates that the AWS KMS key used to encrypt data at rest has been deleted or revoked its grants to OpenSearch Service\. You can't recover domains that are in this state\. If you have a manual snapshot, though, you can use it to migrate the domain's data to a new domain\. The console displays this metric only for domains that encrypt data at rest\. Relevant statistics: Minimum, Maximum  | 
| InvalidHostHeaderRequests |  The number of HTTP requests made to the OpenSearch cluster that included an invalid \(or missing\) host header\. Valid requests include the domain hostname as the host header value\. OpenSearch Service rejects invalid requests for public access domains that don't have a restrictive access policy\. We recommend applying a restrictive access policy to all domains\. If you see large values for this metric, confirm that your OpenSearch clients include the domain hostname \(and not, for example, its IP address\) in their requests\. Relevant statistics: Sum  | 
| OpenSearchRequests\(previously ElasticsearchRequests\) |  The number of requests made to the OpenSearch cluster\. Relevant statistics: Sum  | 
| 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx |  The number of requests to the domain that resulted in the given HTTP response code \(2*xx*, 3*xx*, 4*xx*, 5*xx*\)\. Relevant statistics: Sum  | 
| ThroughputThrottle | Indicates whether requests are being throttled due to the throughput limitations of your EBS volumes\. A value of 1 indicates that some requests were throttled within the selected timeframe\. A value of 0 indicates normal behavior\.If you conistently see a value of 1 for this metric, you can scale instances vertically up to 64 GiB of RAM, at which point you can scale horizontally by adding instances\.Relevant statistics: Minimum, Maximum | 

## Dedicated master node metrics<a name="managedomains-cloudwatchmetrics-master-node-metrics"></a>

Amazon OpenSearch Service provides the following metrics for [dedicated master nodes](managedomains-dedicatedmasternodes.md)\.


| Metric | Description |

| MasterFreeStorageSpace |  This metric is not relevant and can be ignored\. The service does not use master nodes as data nodes\.  | 
| MasterJVMMemoryPressure |  The maximum percentage of the Java heap used for all dedicated master nodes in the cluster\. We recommend moving to a larger instance type when this metric reaches 85 percent\. Relevant statistics: Maximum  The logic for this metric changed in a recent service software update\. For more information, see the [release notes](release-notes.md)\.   | 
| MasterCPUCreditBalance |  The remaining CPU credits available for dedicated master nodes in the cluster\. A CPU credit provides the performance of a full CPU core for one minute\.

## Instance metrics<a name="managedomains-cloudwatchmetrics-instance-metrics"></a>

Amazon OpenSearch Service provides the following metrics for each instance in a domain\. OpenSearch Service also aggregates these instance metrics to provide insight into overall cluster health\. You can verify this behavior using the **Sample Count** statistic in the console\. Note that each metric in the following table has relevant statistics for the node *and* the cluster\.

**Important**  
Different versions of Elasticsearch use different thread pools to process calls to the `_index` API\. Elasticsearch 1\.5 and 2\.3 use the index thread pool\. Elasticsearch 5\.*x*, 6\.0, and 6\.2 use the bulk thread pool\. OpenSearch and Elasticsearch 6\.3 and later use the write thread pool\. Currently, the OpenSearch Service console doesn't include a graph for the bulk thread pool\.  
Use `GET _cluster/settings?include_defaults=true` to check thread pool and queue sizes for your cluster\.
