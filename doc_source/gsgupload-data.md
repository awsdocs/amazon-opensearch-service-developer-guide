# Step 2: Upload data to Amazon OpenSearch Service for indexing<a name="gsgupload-data"></a>

**Important**  
This is a concise tutorial for uploading a small amount of test data to Amazon OpenSearch Service\. For more about uploading data in a production domain, see [Indexing data in Amazon OpenSearch Service](indexing.md)\.

You can upload data to an OpenSearch Service domain using the command line or most programming languages\.

The following example requests use [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) \(a common HTTP client\) for brevity and convenience\. Clients like curl can't perform the request signing that's required if your access policies specify IAM users or roles\. To successfully complete this process, you must use fine\-grained access control with a primary user name and password like you configured in [Step 1](gsgcreate-domain.md)\.

You can install curl on Windows and use it from the command prompt, but we recommend a tool like [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)\. macOS and most Linux distributions come with curl preinstalled\.

## Option 1: Upload a single document<a name="gsgsingle-document"></a>

Run the following command to add a single document to the *movies* domain:

```
curl -XPUT -u 'master-user:master-user-password' 'domain-endpoint/movies/_doc/1' -d '{"director": "Burton, Tim", "genre": ["Comedy","Sci-Fi"], "year": 1996, "actor": ["Jack Nicholson","Pierce Brosnan","Sarah Jessica Parker"], "title": "Mars Attacks!"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

In the command, provide the user name and password that you created in [Step 1](gsgcreate-domain.md)\.

For a detailed explanation of this command and how to make signed requests to OpenSearch Service, see [Indexing data in Amazon OpenSearch Service](indexing.md)\.

## Option 2: Upload multiple documents<a name="gsgmultiple-document"></a>

**To upload a JSON file that contains multiple documents to an OpenSearch Service domain**

1. Create a local file called `bulk_movies.json`\. Paste the following content into the file and add a trailing newline:

   ```
   { "index" : { "_index": "movies", "_id" : "2" } }
   {"director": "Frankenheimer, John", "genre": ["Drama", "Mystery", "Thriller", "Crime"], "year": 1962, "actor": ["Lansbury, Angela", "Sinatra, Frank", "Leigh, Janet", "Harvey, Laurence", "Silva, Henry", "Frees, Paul", "Gregory, James", "Bissell, Whit", "McGiver, John", "Parrish, Leslie", "Edwards, James", "Flowers, Bess", "Dhiegh, Khigh", "Payne, Julie", "Kleeb, Helen", "Gray, Joe", "Nalder, Reggie", "Stevens, Bert", "Masters, Michael", "Lowell, Tom"], "title": "The Manchurian Candidate"}
   { "index" : { "_index": "movies", "_id" : "3" } }
   {"director": "Baird, Stuart", "genre": ["Action", "Crime", "Thriller"], "year": 1998, "actor": ["Downey Jr., Robert", "Jones, Tommy Lee", "Snipes, Wesley", "Pantoliano, Joe", "Jacob, Ir\u00e8ne", "Nelligan, Kate", "Roebuck, Daniel", "Malahide, Patrick", "Richardson, LaTanya", "Wood, Tom", "Kosik, Thomas", "Stellate, Nick", "Minkoff, Robert", "Brown, Spitfire", "Foster, Reese", "Spielbauer, Bruce", "Mukherji, Kevin", "Cray, Ed", "Fordham, David", "Jett, Charlie"], "title": "U.S. Marshals"}
   { "index" : { "_index": "movies", "_id" : "4" } }
   {"director": "Ray, Nicholas", "genre": ["Drama", "Romance"], "year": 1955, "actor": ["Hopper, Dennis", "Wood, Natalie", "Dean, James", "Mineo, Sal", "Backus, Jim", "Platt, Edward", "Ray, Nicholas", "Hopper, William", "Allen, Corey", "Birch, Paul", "Hudson, Rochelle", "Doran, Ann", "Hicks, Chuck", "Leigh, Nelson", "Williams, Robert", "Wessel, Dick", "Bryar, Paul", "Sessions, Almira", "McMahon, David", "Peters Jr., House"], "title": "Rebel Without a Cause"}
   ```

1. Run the following command in the local directory where the file is stored to upload it to the *movies* domain:

   ```
   curl -XPOST -u 'master-user:master-user-password' 'domain-endpoint/_bulk' --data-binary @bulk_movies.json -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
   ```

For more information about the bulk file format, see [Indexing data in Amazon OpenSearch Service](indexing.md)\.
